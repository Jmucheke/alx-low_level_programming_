This projects is a continuation of the nested loops project.
It focuses on the nested C loops and functions in depth.
The projects include:
0. isupper - checks if a letter is uppercase or not.
1. isdigit - function to check if a character is a digit or not.
2. Collaboration is multiplication - function that multiplies two integers.
3. The numbers speak for themselves - function that prints numbers for 0 to 9 using the _putchar function.
4. I believe in numbers and signs - function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9 but does not print 2 and 4
5. Numbers constitute the only universal language - function that prints 10 times the numbers from 0 to 14
6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line - funtion that draws a line in the terminal
7. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe - function that draws a diagnol line on the terminal
8. You are so much sunshine in every square inch - a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.
9. Fizz-Buzz - a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 but for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five pritn FiveBuzz.
10. Triangles - function that prints a trinagle followed by a new line.
11. The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic - program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143.
12. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper - function that prints an integer
You can only use _putchar function to print
You are not allowed to use long
You are not allowed to use arrays or pointers
You are not allowed to hard-code special values
