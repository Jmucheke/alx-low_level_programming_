Recursion - is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.
C programs on recursion.
The program includes;
0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget - the function prints a string, followed by a new line.
1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together - the program prints a string in reverse.
2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange - the program returns the length of a string.
3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling -the program returns the factorial of a given number.
4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate
 - the program returns the value of x reised to the power of y.
5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer - the program returns the natural square root of a number.
6. Inception. Is it possible? - the program returns 1  if the input integer is a prime number.
7. They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything - program returns 1 if a string is palindrome and 0 if not.
8. Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...
 - the program compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered indentical, otherwise return 0.
