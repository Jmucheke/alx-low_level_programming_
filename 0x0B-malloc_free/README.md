4. It's not bragging if you can back it up - a program that frees a 2D grid previously creted by your alloc_grid function.
5. It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it's the pebble in your shoe - a program that contenates all the arguments of your program.
6. I will show you how great I am - a program that splits a string into words.
